# E-commerce_Sales_and_Customer_Insights_Dashboard
SQL-based project analyzing e-commerce sales and customer data to uncover actionable insights. The analysis identifies top-selling product categories, high-spending customers and regions, and segments customers by purchasing power (High, Medium, and Low Value).

Project Questions:
* Which product categories generate the most revenue?
* Who are the highest-spending customers and which regions manage them?
* How can customers be segmented based on purchasing power?

## Project Questions and Insights

### Which product categories generate the most revenue?

* From the insight Accessories  and Clothing are highlighted as key categories due to the large amount of revenue generated from there.
* Accessories products dominate in sales volume (higher quantities ordered), making it the strongest revenue driver.
* Clothing and Sports products also contributed significantly.

### Who are the highest-spending customers and which regions manage them?

* The  INNER JOIN.sql query linked orders with customers and sales reps, enabling identification of top-spending customers and which sales reps/regions manage them.
* Insight: The East Region consistently handles higher-value customers — pointing to strong customer relationships or regional purchasing power.

### How can customers be segmented based on purchasing power?
 
* I grouped customers into different categories to differentiate between the High Value Customers, the Medium Value  Customers and the Low Value Customers for the company to carry out various discount plans and subscription plans  for customers. I noticed we had more high value customers at our company.
