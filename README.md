E-commerce Sales &amp; Customer Insights Dashboard – SQL-based project analyzing sales and customer data. Showing key insights: on the product category with the most revenue, Highest Spending Customers &amp; Regions, Customer Category Based on their Purchasing Power (Customer Segmentation).

## Project Questions and Insights

### Top-Selling Categories

* From the insight Accessories  and Clothing are highlighted as key categories due to the large amount of revenue generated from there.
* Accessories products dominate in sales volume (higher quantities ordered), making it the strongest revenue driver.
* Clothing and Sports products also contributed significantly.

### High-Spending Customers & Regions

* The  INNER JOIN.sql query linked orders with customers and sales reps, enabling identification of top-spending customers and which sales reps/regions manage them.
*Insight: The East Region consistently handles higher-value customers — pointing to strong customer relationships or regional purchasing power.

### Customer Category Based on their Purchasing Power (Customer Segmentation)
 
* I grouped customers into different categories to differentiate between the High Value Customers, the Medium Value  Customers and the Low Value Customers for the company to carry out various discount plans and subscription plans  for customers. I noticed we had more high value customers at our company.
